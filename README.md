# jupyter-client

A Clojure library to interact with a jupyter kernel.

This library allows you to run [execute_requests](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html)
against a jupyter kernel and view what comes back from the kernel's stdout (if anything). 

## Usage

```clojure
(req-msg :config-file "/Users/pdenno/Library/Jupyter/runtime/kernel-5aae1612-b3e1-46a1-b926-c6ab30a94d7e.json"
         :code (str "foobar = 'Greetings from Clojure!'\n"
                    "print(foobar)"))
```
Returns `{:status :ok, :stdout "Greetings from Clojure!\n"}` and sets the variable foobar in the kernel.
(Note that this example is running against a Python kernel.)

Limitations:

Limitation 1: The code doesn't currently generate signed messages correctly. Therefore, it is necessary
to turn signature checking off in the kernel. For a jupyter lab kernel, for example, this is achieved
by the following line in ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py:

`c.Session.key = b''`

Similarly, if you are using jupyter console, or perhaps clojupyter (that not yet been tested) connect.json
should contain `"key": "",`. 

Limitation 2: I have provided no tests in the testing directory. Shame on me. I'll fix it soon, I hope.
