# jupyter-client

A Clojure library to interact with a jupyter kernel.

For use with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), this library allows one to run
[execute_requests](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html)
against a jupyter kernel and view what (if anything) comes back from the kernel's stdout. 

## Usage

```clojure
(req-msg :config-file "/Users/pdenno/Library/Jupyter/runtime/kernel-5aae1612-b3e1-46a1-b926-c6ab30a94d7e.json"
         :code (str "foobar = 'Greetings from Clojure!'\n"
                    "print(foobar)"))
```
Returns `{:status :ok, :stdout "Greetings from Clojure!\n"}` and sets the variable foobar in the kernel.
(Note that this example is running against a
[IPython kernel](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/how_jupyter_ipython_work.html#the-ipython-kernel).)

Some of the code here was borrowed from the [clojupyter project](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter).
Thanks to everyone involved. 

Limitations:

Limitation 1: The code doesn't currently generate signed messages correctly. Therefore, it is necessary
to turn signature checking off in the kernel. For a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) kernel, for example, this is achieved
by uncommenting the following line in ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py:

`c.Session.key = b''`

Similarly, if you are using jupyter console, or perhaps clojupyter (that not yet been tested) connect.json
should contain `"key": "",`. 

Limitation 2: I have provided no tests in the testing directory. Shame on me. I'll fix it soon, I hope.
